a docker container which runs [keepalived.org](http://keepalived.org/)

orginally based on the work of [linkvt](https://github.com/linkvt/docker-keepalived) but simplified the approach for my own needs along the way.

## run

This image require the kernel module ip_vs loaded on the host;

```
# modprobe ip_vs
```

and needs to be run with the NET_ADMIN linux capability using the host network mode;

```
$ docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_BROADCAST --cap-add=NET_RAW --net=host --name keepalived --rm visibilityspots/keepalived:latest
```

## Configuration

Environment variables defaults are set in the Dockerfile and can be overriden;

```
ENV KEEPALIVED_INTERFACE eth0
ENV KEEPALIVED_STATE BACKUP
ENV KEEPALIVED_ROUTER_ID 21
ENV KEEPALIVED_PRIORITY 150
ENV KEEPALIVED_UNICAST_PEERS 192.168.0.11 - 192.168.0.12
ENV KEEPALIVED_VIRTUAL_IPS 192.168.0.10
ENV KEEPALIVED_VIRTUAL_ROUTES 192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0 scope link src 192.168.0.10
ENV KEEPALIVED_PASSWORD d0ck3r
ENV KEEPALIVED_NOTIFY notify "/usr/local/bin/keepalived-notify.sh"
```

### Override ENV variables

Environment variables can be set by adding the --env argument in the command line, for example:


```
$ docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_BROADCAST --cap-add=NET_RAW --net=host --env KEEPALIVED_INTERFACE="eno1" --env KEEPALIVED_PASSWORD="password!" --env KEEPALIVED_PRIORITY="100" --name keepalived --rm visibilityspots/keepalived:latest
```

## build

```
$ docker build -t visibilityspots/keepalived:latest .
```

### buildx

```
$ docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
$ docker buildx build -t visibilityspots/keepalived:latest --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm/v6,linux/arm/v7 --push .
```

### dgoss

I wrote some tests in a goss.yaml file which can be executed by [dgoss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/tree/master/extras/dgoss) to test the created image

```
$ dgoss run visibilityspots/keepalived:2.2.8

### act

using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act#overview----) for local testing of the written github actions makes my life and commit history a lot easier;

```
Stage  Job ID  Job name  Workflow name           Workflow file               Events
0      update  update    docker-hub-description  docker-hub-description.yml  push
0      main    main      CI                      main.yml                    push
0      scan    scan      trivy                   trivy.yml                   push,schedule
```
